Open5e
======

Open5e aims to be the best open-source resource for 5e content.

.. Sidebar:: Hey! Stuff is missing!
   :class: missing

   Some content you may be expecting was not released as part of the `5e SRD <http://media.wizards.com/2016/downloads/DND/SRD-OGL_V5.1.pdf>`_,
   so we aren't allowed to include it in this site.

   We are hoping to fill in the gaps using quality homebrew and 3rd party OGL content.
   `Contact us <mailto:gm@5esrd.com>`_ or `make a pull request <http://github.com/eepMoody/open5e>`_ if you know something we should add!

   .. rst-class:: source

We're working on a new version of the site!
----------------------------------------------------------

If you enjoy Open5e, join us on Discord to talk about it. Also consider supporting us on Patreon to help cover our (new) server costs.

Our discord is a place to talk about rules, tools, DM'ing, art, gaming in general, or anything else on your mind! Our patreon will initially be focused on collecting enough to get better hosting and rebuild in a new framework. After that we will start working on generating art and content to make running and playing in games better.
